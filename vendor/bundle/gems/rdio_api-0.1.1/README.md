Rdio
====================
Ruby wrapper for the [Rdio](http://rdio.com) API. Inspired by [Linkedin gem](https://github.com/pengwynn/linkedin) & [Twitter gem](https://github.com/jnunemaker/twitter).


Installation
------------
    gem install rdio_api


Usage
-----

Register for developer keys at [http://developer.rdio.com/](http://developer.rdio.com/).

All the methods are exactly as in the [API docs](http://developer.rdio.com/docs/read/rest/Methods), camel cased and all the endpoints are also exactly the same.

OAuth flow is not part of this gem. Recommend using [OmniAuth](https://github.com/intridea/omniauth). Also check Rdio [OAuth documentation](http://developer.rdio.com/docs/read/rest/oauth).


Usage Examples
--------------
    require "rubygems"
    require "rdio_api"

    # Initialize a new Rdio client
    client = RdioApi.new(:consumer_key => CONSUMER_KEY, :consumer_secret => CONSUMER_SECRET)

    # Get songs in heavy rotation
    client.getHeavyRotation(:type => "albums")

	# Get top playlists
	client.getTopCharts(:type => "Playlist")

	# Search for a query and and pass in the type
	client.search(:query => "michael giacchino", :types => "album")

	# Get activity stream of a user
	client.getActivityStream(:user => "s12345", :scope => "user")

	# Find a user by email address
	client.findUser(:email => "email@example.com")

	# Methods that act on behalf of a user require an access token, OmniAuth is best for this

	# Access token can be set at initialization
	client = RdioApi.new(:consumer_key => CONSUMER_KEY,
						 :consumer_secret => CONSUMER_SECRET,
						 :access_token => ACCESS_TOKEN)

	# Access token can also be set at the clien't access_token instance variable
	client.access_token = ACCESS_TOKEN

	# Get info about the current user
	client.currentUser

	# Add a friend
	client.addFriend(:user => "s12345")

	# Create a Playlist
	client.createPlaylist(:name => "RubyGem",
	                      :description => "Testing",
	                      :tracks => "t1945474, t3483614")

TODO
----
* Explore moving methods from camel case to snake case and update tests accordingly
* OAuth flow
* More tests for methods and for each endpoints
* Test and Support multiple Rubies
